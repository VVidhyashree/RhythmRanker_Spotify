🎧 RhythmRanker: AI-Powered Song Popularity Forecast A comprehensive, end-to-end data science solution focused on deciphering the complex patterns that drive music popularity. The project leverages Machine Learning to accurately forecast a song's success (Spotify Stream Counts) using real-world audio features and market visibility data.


🧠 Problem Statement & Value Proposition Challenge: In the competitive streaming landscape, identifying a "hit song" before its release is a multi-million dollar decision. Traditional scouting methods are subjective and slow.

Solution: This project delivers an objective, data-driven tool capable of estimating a song's Spotify stream potential based on key audio metrics (e.g., Energy, Danceability) and critical platform indicators (playlist placement, chart presence).

⚙️ Tech Stack & Methodology Category,Tools & Libraries,Key Application Languages,Python (3.x),Core programming for data processing and modeling. Frameworks,Streamlit,"Built and deployed a fully modular, multi-page interactive dashboard accessible via a web browser."

Modeling,"Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost",Utilized advanced ensemble techniques for high-accuracy regression forecasting.

Libraries,"pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, joblib","Data wrangling, ML utilities, high-performance training, and model persistence."

📊 Key Results & Impact📈 Modeling PerformanceApproach: Evaluated multiple models using both raw and log-transformed data to stabilize variance and improve linearity.Best Model: Random Forest Regressor applied to log-transformed stream counts.Accuracy: Achieved a strong predictive performance with an R² score of 
≈
0.79
 (79%). 🎯 Feature ImportanceTop Predictors: Metrics related to Playlist Presence (Spotify, Apple, Deezer) and Chart Visibility proved to be the most critical drivers of future stream counts.Audio Traits: Energy and Danceability were identified as the most impactful intrinsic audio features, helping determine a song's compatibility with popular playlists. 🌐 Dashboard CapabilitiesInteractive EDA: Visualize correlations and distributions directly on the web app.Live Prediction Tool: Allows users to input hypothetical song metrics and receive an instant, forecasted stream count. 💼 Business ImplicationsThis tool provides quantifiable intelligence to maximize music investment:A&R Strategy: Objectively scout high-potential tracks and artists before massive market exposure.Marketing & Scheduling: Optimize release times and platform strategy based on feature trends and seasonality.Playlist Curation: Identify musical traits that guarantee maximum compatibility with high-traffic algorithmic playlists.
