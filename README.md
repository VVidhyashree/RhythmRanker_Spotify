# RhythmRanker_Spotify
🎧 RhythmRanker: AI-Powered Song Popularity ForecastA comprehensive, end-to-end data science solution focused on deciphering the complex patterns that drive music popularity. The project leverages Machine Learning to accurately forecast a song's success (Spotify Stream Counts) using real-world audio features and market visibility data.Live Deployment: [https://song-analysis-data-science-project.streamlit.app/]🎯 Project Goal & Problem StatementChallenge: In the competitive streaming landscape, identifying a "hit song" before its release is a critical business decision.Solution: This project delivers an objective, data-driven tool capable of estimating a song's Spotify stream potential based on key audio metrics (e.g., Energy, Danceability) and critical platform indicators (playlist placement, chart presence). This provides actionable intelligence for record label A&R and Marketing teams.⚙️ Tech Stack & MethodologyCategoryTools & LibrariesKey ApplicationLanguagesPython (3.x)Core programming for data processing and modeling.FrameworksStreamlitBuilt and deployed a fully modular, multi-page interactive dashboard accessible via a web browser.ModelingRandom Forest Regressor, XGBoostUtilized advanced ensemble techniques for high-accuracy regression forecasting.Librariespandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, joblibData wrangling, ML utilities, high-performance training, and model persistence.📊 Key Results & Impact📈 Modeling PerformanceApproach: Evaluated multiple models using both raw and log-transformed data to stabilize variance.Best Model: Random Forest Regressor applied to log-transformed stream counts.Accuracy: Achieved a strong predictive performance with an R² score of $\approx 0.79$ (79%).🎯 Business ValueA&R Strategy: Provides quantifiable intelligence to objectively scout high-potential tracks.Top Predictors: Metrics related to Playlist Presence (Spotify, Apple, Deezer) and Chart Visibility proved to be the most critical drivers of future stream counts.Audio Traits: Energy and Danceability were identified as the most impactful intrinsic audio features.📁 Project StructureBash.
